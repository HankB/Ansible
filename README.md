# Ansible

Various Ansible stuff.

## Motivation

Time set aside the videos and books and start writing Ansible playbooks.

## Contributing

I'm striving to reach noob status with Ansible. Any suggestions for how to improve any of these playbooks would be very welcome. Any other suggestions such as correction of typos, clarification of unclear descriptions or other are also very welcome.
